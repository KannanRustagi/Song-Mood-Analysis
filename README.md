More details of the ideas, implementation and results can be found in the final report.<br>

We have devised an innovative approach to predict a track’s mood based on audio
features. We have mainly classified a song into one of four moods – calm, happy,
energetic, and sad. For EDA, we have constructed Heatmaps correlating the features,
Radar plots, and KDE plots for better visualization of our data. We attempted to do
feature selection using Principal Component Analysis. We have implemented
Classification as well as Clustering methods from scratch in python to model our data. The Classification
models include the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier, Decision Tree, Random Forest
Classifier, and K-Nearest Neighbours. We have contrasted the results we obtained from our custom implementation with those obtained by using Sklearn's implementation as well. As for clustering, we have employed the K-Means
algorithm. After this, we compared the results obtained from both paradigms and
attempted to draw conclusions on our dataset
